# Changelog

Reactist follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and doesn't introduce breaking changes (API-wise) in minor or patch releases. However, the appearance of a component might change in a minor or patch release so keep an eye on redesigns and make sure your app still looks and feels like you expect it.

## 2.0.3

- [Tweak] Changed namespacing from `.reactist.popover {}` to `.reactist_popover {}`.

## 2.0.2

- [Tweak] Changed time formatting from `yesterday` to `1d`

## 2.0.1

-   _Empty release_

## 2.0.0

-   [Breaking] Styles are no longer included automatically but need to be loaded manually. See the readme for a detailed instruction on how to achieve that.

## 1.22.06

-   [New] Added a `refresh` prop to `<Time />` component in order to keep the information shown up-to-date when the component displays "time ago". By default, the component will re-render every 60 seconds.

## 1.22.05

-   [Fix] Fixed the `display: intial` CSS rule for IE11 users (affects the `<Popover />` component)

## 1.22.04

-   [Tweak] Fixed unsupported `display: initial` in IE11

## 1.22.04

-   [Tweak] Fixed broken styles for `<Modal>` on small screens

## 1.22.03

-   [Tweak] `<Popover />` content can now be a function which will only be lazily evaluated

## 1.22.02

-   [Tweak] `<Popover />` content is now rendered lazily (i.e. only if `visible` is `true`)

## 1.22.01

-   [Tweak] `<Modal.Body />` now starts to scroll instead of requiring the whole window to scroll.

## 1.22.00

-   [Tweak] `<Dropdown.Body />` can now be a function which allows for lazy evaluation (i.e. content is only rendered when dropdown is opened).

## 1.21.00

-   [Tweak] introduced `.npmignore` file to keep released package smaller and only include the essentials. This also fixes a bug in **v1.20.00** where parts of the `.git` directory ended up in the file package.

## 1.20.00

-   [Tweak] Replaced Moment with [Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs)

    üö® This introduces a new peerDependency (`dayjs`) and removes the need for `moment`. If you're not using the `<Time />` nothing should change for you.

## 1.19.00

-   [Tweak] Changed the way the `<Time />` component formats it's time. You now have more control to influence the date and time format from the outside

-   [New] `<ColorPicker />` now comes in a `small` version which is only 18px squared instead of 24px

## 1.18.02

-   [Tweak] When clicking on the trigger of a `<Tooltip />` (i.e. its children) we will close the Tooltip. This is helpful so tooltips no longer overlap menu. In case you need more finegrained control over this consider using a `<Popover />` directly.

## 1.17.03

## 1.17.01

-   [Tweak] Unified all border colors across all components

## 1.16.07

-   [Tweak] We now update the styles of `<Input />` when supplying the `disabled` property

-   [Tweak] Darkened border color of `<Select />` to border color constant

-   [Tooling] Updated to webpack 4, babel 7 and fixed some problems in our build process. `moment`, `classnames` and `prop-types` are now correctly treated as externals and are no longer included in our production bundle. This resulted in a reduced stat size from 703kb to 160kb ‚ö°Ô∏è

## 1.15.24

-   [Bug] When closing a modal by pressing esc we now prevent the browser's default behaviour (e.g. leaving fullscreen mode)

## 1.15.23

-   [Bug] Clicking on the inner overlay of `<Modal />` (aka left or right of the modal) when `closeOnOverlayClick` was set to `true` the modal wouldn't close

## 1.15.22

-   [Bug] Changing the `right` prop of `<Dropdown />` didn't have any effect as it was "cached" in internal state upon first construction

## 1.15.21

-   [Tweak] Added rounded corners to the blue line indicating an active tab

## 1.15.20

## 1.15.13

-   [Tweak] Set the margin of `<Select />` to 0 to avoid browser inconsistencies in Safari

## 1.15.12

-   [Tweak] Instead of using the default delay of 1s (1000ms) for tooltips when hovering the `<Time />` component we now use 500ms (0.5s)

## 1.15.11

-   [Redesign] The `<ColorPicker />` can now show an optional active indicator on the selected color item.
    -   Additionally, we no longer hide the active color from the selection. That means you might need to check in your code that an actual change occurred.
-   [Bug] When supplying an invalid `color` prop to the `<ColorPicker />` it would crash. Now it selects the first color in the `colorList`.

## 1.15.10
