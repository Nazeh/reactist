# Changelog

Reactist follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and doesn't introduce breaking changes (API-wise) in minor or patch releases. However, the appearance of a component might change in a minor or patch release so keep an eye on redesigns and make sure your app still looks and feels like you expect it.

## 1.15.24
- [Bug] When closing a modal by pressing esc we now prevent the browser's default behaviour (e.g. leaving fullscreen mode)

## 1.15.23
- [Bug] Clicking on the inner overlay of `<Modal />` (aka left or right of the modal) when `closeOnOverlayClick` was set to `true` the modal wouldn't close

## 1.15.22
- [Bug] Changing the `right` prop of `<Dropdown />` didn't have any effect as it was "cached" in internal state upon first construction

## 1.15.21
- [Tweak] Added rounded corners to the blue line indicating an active tab

## 1.15.20
- [Bug] Setting `useCapture` to `true` to catch scroll events of all elements of a page to correctly hide the tooltip

## 1.15.19
- [New] Added `gapSize` to `<Tooltip />`

## 1.15.18
- [Redesign] The `<Loading />` indicator is now a spinning circle instead of three bouncing dots

## 1.15.17
- [Tweak] Inactive tabs use the secondary font color instead of custom gray

## 1.15.16
- [Tweak] Darkened primary and secondary font colors for improved readability

## 1.15.15
- [New] Added support for the `style` property to `<Modal.Box />` and `<Modal.Body />` for when a className is not enough

## 1.15.14
- [Tweak] Sets the default value of the `delayShow` of the `<Tooltip />` component to 500ms (0.5s) instead of 1s

## 1.15.13
- [Tweak] Set the margin of `<Select />` to 0 to avoid browser inconsistencies in Safari

## 1.15.12
- [Tweak] Instead of using the default delay of 1s (1000ms) for tooltips when hovering the `<Time />` component we now use 500ms (0.5s)

## 1.15.11
- [Redesign] The `<ColorPicker />` can now show an optional active indicator on the selected color item.
    - Additionally, we no longer hide the active color from the selection. That means you might need to check in your code that an actual change occurred.
- [Bug] When supplying an invalid `color` prop to the `<ColorPicker />` it would crash. Now it selects the first color in the `colorList`.

## 1.15.10
- [Tweak] Increased the size of the white inner ring that appears when hovering a color item of the `<ColorPicker />`

## 1.15.9

- [Redesign] New design for the `<ColorPicker />`
    - It now shows the color name on hover â€“ when supplied through the `colorList` prop
- [Bug] `<Tooltip />`s are now correctly displayed in absolutely positioned elements (esp. `<Dropdown />`s)
