### ⭐️ New component

Describe the functionality of your proposed component and add a design or mockup when available.

### 🐛 Bug

Please include the version of Reactist you are using and detailed steps to reproduce the issue.

"Button is not working" is not a good issue description while "Button not being disabled during loading state" is. We hope you get the gist. Adding more information or even a small repo / fiddle showing the bug in action is always recommended 😊

### ⚙️ Improvement

You would like to add more functionality to an existing component? Improve our bundling process? Write more tests? Or a component's behaviour should change?

Let us know what we should improve and we'll work on a solution together.
